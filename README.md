# PracticalQuiz1

Hi! 
This project was a task given to all the participants of Google India Scholarship 2018.

In this Project , we needed to create two Activities as follows:
1) MainActivity
This included 3 EditText and a toolbar with menu option (showing Icon).

2) DetailsActivity
It contained 1 ImageView and 3 TextView and the content of the TextView were taken from MainActivity using SharedPreferences.
It also contained ToolBar which had a option of going back (<--).

Through this project, we revised and practiced the following concepts:
- UI designing along wth proper attributes
- ToolBar and its properties
- OptionsMenu and Previous button in ToolBar
- SharedPreferences 
- Explicit Intent
